A paragraph is a group of related sentences focused on a single main idea or topic, acting as a self-contained unit of writing that organizes longer pieces of prose. It is typically marked by an indent or line break and often starts with a topic sentence that introduces the central idea, followed by supporting sentences that provide details or evidence, and sometimes concludes with a sentence that summarizes or links to the next point. Paragraphs are crucial for structuring a piece of writing, making it easier for the reader to follow the flow of ideas and the author's argument.
